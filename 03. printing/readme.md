####  General 
%v	the value in a default format when printing structs, the plus flag (%+v) adds field names
%#v	a Go-syntax representation of the value
%T	a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value
%%	a literal percent sign; consumes no value

####   The default format for %v is: 

bool:                    %t
int, int8 etc.:          %d
uint, uint8 etc.:        %d, %#x if printed with %#v
float32, complex64, etc: %g
string:                  %s
chan:                    %p
pointer:                 %p

####  Boolean 
%t	the word true or false

#### Integers 
%b	base 2
%c	the character represented by the corresponding Unicode code point
%d	base 10
%o	base 8
%O	base 8 with 0o prefix
%q	a single-quoted character literal safely escaped with Go syntax.
%x	base 16, with lower-case letters for a-f
%X	base 16, with upper-case letters for A-F
%U	Unicode format: U+1234; same as "U+%04X"

#### Floating-point and complex constituents
%b	decimalless scientific notation with exponent a power of two, in the manner of strconv.FormatFloat with the 'b' format, e.g. -123456p-78
%e	scientific notation, e.g. -1.234456e+78
%E	scientific notation, e.g. -1.234456E+78
%f	decimal point but no exponent, e.g. 123.456
%F	synonym for %f
%g	%e for large exponents, %f otherwise. Precision is discussed below.
%G	%E for large exponents, %F otherwise
%x	hexadecimal notation (with decimal power of two exponent), e.g. -0x1.23abcp+20
%X	upper-case hexadecimal notation, e.g. -0X1.23ABCP+20

####  String and slice of bytes (treated equivalently with these verbs)
%s	the uninterpreted bytes of the string or slice
%q	a double-quoted string safely escaped with Go syntax
%x	base 16, lower-case, two characters per byte
%X	base 16, upper-case, two characters per byte

####   Slice  
%p	address of 0th element in base 16 notation, with leading 0x

####  Pointer
%p	base 16 notation, with leading 0x
The %b, %d, %o, %x and %X verbs also work with pointers,
formatting the value exactly as if it were an integer.
